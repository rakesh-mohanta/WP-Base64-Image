This is just a random idea of substituting http image urls to inline base 64 data URIs instead. It's probably not a good idea since I've never seen anyone argue that it is. The biggest problem is that images won't be cached and thus needs to be loaded on every page request. 

However I'd just like to try it out. Use it on your own risk.
